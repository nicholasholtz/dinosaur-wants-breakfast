# Dinosaur Wants Breakfast
This is my effort at Problem Set 0 in Harvard's CS50 online course. 

I want to create a game where I, as the main character, a dinosaur, am very hungry and must eat doughnuts. My goal is to get to 10 doughnuts eaten to satiate my morning appetite. But I have nemeses. And I'm in outer space.
- There is a problematic squirrel, always trying to get my doughnut. 
    - If the squirrel eats my doughnut before me, my score drops by 1. 
    - If I run into the squirrel, 
        - I am sent to a random spot on the board, and 
        - A new squirrel shows up.
- There is random space lightning. Lightning is dangerous. 
    - Lightning pops up out of nowhere. 
    - If I get hit by space lightning, it zaps my energy, and I lose 3 points. 
- The doughnut is not easy to catch. 
    - It is slightly faster than me, always moving a little quicker than I can. 
    - Every once in a while, it will disappear and land at a new spot.
